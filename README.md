# Disaggregate

I'd always wanted to create a blog on my own, having used WordPress for the longest time. ["The Lobster Journal"](https://thelobsterjournal.wordpress.com) isn't exactly the best of names and it didn't sit well with me that as a CS student I wasn't doing something by myself. Thus, this project began. 

I'm using [11ty.js](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) as the platform for this.
